## Installation

RBC is available on both conda-forge and PyPI.

### conda/mamba

You can use either [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
or [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to install RBC. We suggest using
mamba as it uses a faster solver.

```bash
conda create --name rbc_env
conda activate rbc_env
conda install -c conda-forge rbc
```

### Pip

On PyPI, the RBC library is called `rbc-project`.

```bash
pip install rbc-project
```
